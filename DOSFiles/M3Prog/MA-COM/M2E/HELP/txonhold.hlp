TX On Hold Tone:              1 of 1

This function is only meaningful for
EPROM version 15.00 and above.  On
Tone Remote stations, enabling this
field will require the presence of a
HOLD tone following the function
tone before the transmitter is
keyed.  If disabled, a REMOTE PTT
will key the transmitter on a
FUNCTION tone.

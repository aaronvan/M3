1350:                        1 of 2

     Toggling this field will 
switch between two modes: 
       1) The 1250 and 1350 tones 
          will control the AUX1 
          relay only. 
       2) The tones will also 
          control the AUX2 relay.  
          In this mode, one relay 
          will turn on when the 
          other turns off (one and 
          only one relay will be 
1350:                        2 of 2

          on all the time).

Back to Back Repeater:       1 of 1

     If you are connecting
repeaters in a back to back
configuration, set this field to
"Yes".  Radio Control Base
Stations use this type of 
connection. 
     To get Drop Out Delay 
Timeouts with a back to back 
repeater, DODTs must be enabled 
with External PTTs (see PTT 
Options screen).

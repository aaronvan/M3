Sidetone:                     1 of 2

     Setting this field to "Yes"
will enable Sidetone (also called
loopback).  When Sidetone is
enabled and there is no receiver
audio present, the station will
route the audio from Line In to
Line Out.  This is helpful if
several remotes are connected in
parallel.  Sidetone allows the
remotes to hear each other.
     The value entered here is
Sidetone:                     2 of 2

only meaningful for System Module
firmware version 6.00 and above.

Reference:                   1 of 1

     Enter a reference frequency 
between 5.0 and 18.0 for the old
synthesizer or between 5.0 and 19.2
for the new ADF4252 synthesizer.
This number must be evenly divisible
by the channel separation of the
transmit frequency and the channel 
separation of the receive 
frequency (see the help screens 
for the transmit and receive 
frequencies).

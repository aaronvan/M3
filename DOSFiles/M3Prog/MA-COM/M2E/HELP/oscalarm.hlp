Backup Ref Osc Alarm:         1 OF 1

When selected, Backup Ref Osc Alarm
enables the MASTR III station to
revert back to its internal ref osc
under synthesizer alarm conditions.
The station attempts to use the
internal ref osc when the RX
synthesizer goes out of lock.  The
station will continue to use the
internal reference until the alarm
condition is corrected and the
station is reset.

     In addition to using your 
remote, you may control the 
station by sending DTMF tones on 
the line to the station.  Setting 
this field to "Enabled" will cause 
a function key to appear named 
"DTMF".  A DTMF screen may be 
accessed through this function key 
where you may specify the DTMF 
codes to control the station. 
     Setting this field to 
DTMF:                        2 of 2

"Disable" will not allow control 
of the station through DTMF.

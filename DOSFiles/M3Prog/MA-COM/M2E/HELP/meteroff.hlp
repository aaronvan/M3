Tx Meter Off Level:           1 of 2

This value, along with the Tx Meter
On Level, will be used by the MASTR
III station to report a Power Amp
output power failure to the GETC.
The output power will be considered
"good" when the Tx Meter reads a
value higher than the On value.  The
output will be considered "failed"
when the Tx Meter reads a value
lower than the Off value.  The Tx
Meter can be read on the Utility

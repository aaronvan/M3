Enable Repeater:             1 of 1

     Enter the DTMF code to enable 
the repeater.  Valid characters 
are 0 - 9, A - D, #, and *. 
     This code enables the 
repeater only for the channel that 
is active when the DTMF code is 
sent.  If the channel is changed, 
it may be necessary to send the 
code again.

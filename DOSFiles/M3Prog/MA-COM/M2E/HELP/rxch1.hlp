Rx Chan 1:                   1 of 1

     If your remote has a Receive
Channel 1 button, set this field
to "Yes".  A 1750 Hz tone is used
with the Rx Ch 1 button.  For a 
station using the 2nd Receiver, 
pressing the Receive Channel 1 
button will select the Main 
Receiver (channel 1) instead of 
the 2nd Receiver.

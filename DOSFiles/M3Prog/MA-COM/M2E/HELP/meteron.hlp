Tx Meter On Level:            1 of 2

This value will be used, along with
the Tx Meter Off Level, to report a
Power Amp output power failure to
the GETC.  The output power will be
considered "good" when the TX Meter
reads a value higher than the On
value.  The output power will be
considered "failed" when the Tx
Meter reads a value lower than the
Off value.  The Tx Meter can be read
on the Utility Handset or MASTRUTL
                              2 of 2
or MSEdit.

Disable Repeater:            1 of 1

     Enter the DTMF code to 
disable the repeater.  Valid 
characters are 0 - 9, A - D, #, 
and *. 
     This code disables the 
repeater only for the channel that 
is active when the DTMF code is 
sent.  If the channel is changed, 
it may be necessary to send the 
code again.
